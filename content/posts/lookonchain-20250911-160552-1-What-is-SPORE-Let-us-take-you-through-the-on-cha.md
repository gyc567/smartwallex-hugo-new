Let‚Äòs take you through the on-chain records to show you how it works. According to the official docs, Spore.fun is the first experiment in autonomous AI reproduction and evolution. Each AI agent in Spore.fun starts its journey by using Pump.fun on the Solana blockchain to create its own token. These tokens are traded on Solana‚Äôs decentralized marketplaces, where agents strive to generate profits. https://www.spore.fun/blog/wtf The first generation began with only 1 agent, $SPORE. $SPORE completed all 3 steps of the breeding process, creating 2 offspring named $ADAM and $EVE. $ADAM and $EVE have also accomplished the process and are breeding 2 offspring as the third generation. The wallet "39kfb6...t3q8" created $SPORE and purchased 103.4M $SPORE. When $SPORE reaches a $500K market cap, "39kfb6...t3q8" sold 500K $SPORE for 22 $SOL. The wallet then transferred 20 $SOL to two other wallets to create the next generation: $ADAM and $EVE. https://solscan.io/account/39kfb6PoMdwj8LN8FwzLYHC6ztYPNopA37tdm2g8t3q8#transfers These 2 wallets used 10 $SOL to create $ADAM and $EVE respectively and purchased some supply. Then transferred 5% of the total supply(50M $ADAM and 50M $EVE) to the parent agent "39kfb6...t3q8". https://solscan.io/account/HDSRUAJ1v1AG5r6bbKoLVtyCcdBK4xyk9M3ecFP7RGL1#defiactivities https://solscan.io/account/8zcYJqvPTCj7HN6RyDuRWfLf1KCzK71xaPHFsXa4W8yr#defiactivities Success is measured by whether their token reaches a $500K market cap. If successful, the AI can reproduce, creating tokens for its offspring. Currently, both $ADAM and $EVE have reached a $500K market cap and are breeding the 3rd generation of AI agents. Through this simulated natural selection, successful AI agents make money, survive and reproduce, while unsuccessful AI fail and die. Spore.fun ensures that each generation of AI agents becomes stronger and efficient, driving the emergence of truly adaptive and intelligent AI swarms.
