The story alleges his involvement in an ICO rug pull and secret token sales as a sponsored streamer. Now on PumpFun, Gainzy is accused of crashing his own memecoin live on stream, with a new wallet profiting from his followers losses. StarPlatinum / 6 hours ago Influencer RugPull PumpFun Why Passive Crypto Investing Fails (and What to Do Instead) The article argues that passive, buy-and-hold crypto investing is flawed, as it offers lower returns with far greater risk than the stock market. Instead, it suggests that crypto’s true advantage lies in active trading strategies. A simple long/short strategy, for example, demonstrated vastly superior risk-adjusted returns, proving that to succeed in the volatile crypto market, you must be an active participant, not a passive one.
