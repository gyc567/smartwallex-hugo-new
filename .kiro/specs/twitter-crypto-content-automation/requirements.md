# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated system that searches Twitter for cryptocurrency and blockchain-related content, identifies the top 3 most retweeted posts, translates and converts them into Chinese markdown articles, and automatically publishes them to a Hugo static site via GitHub Actions. The system will run twice daily (9 AM and 9 PM) to ensure fresh, relevant content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to automatically discover trending cryptocurrency content on Twitter, so that I can stay current with the most popular discussions in the crypto community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL search Twitter using the Twitter API (https://docs.twitterapi.io/introduction) for cryptocurrency and blockchain keywords
2. WHEN searching Twitter THEN the system SHALL use relevant keywords including "cryptocurrency", "blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "DeFi", "NFT", "Web3", "crypto"
3. WHEN retrieving search results THEN the system SHALL identify the top 3 tweets with the highest retweet count from the search results
4. WHEN processing tweets THEN the system SHALL extract the original tweet content, author information, and engagement metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Chinese-speaking audience, I want the trending Twitter content to be translated into Chinese and formatted as readable articles, so that I can easily understand and consume the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing the top 3 tweets THEN the system SHALL translate the original English content into Chinese
2. WHEN creating articles THEN the system SHALL use the existing md-template.md format as the template structure
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive articles that expand on the original tweet content with context and analysis
4. WHEN formatting articles THEN the system SHALL include proper front matter with title, date, tags, categories, and description in Chinese
5. WHEN creating titles THEN the system SHALL generate engaging Chinese titles that reflect the tweet content
6. WHEN adding metadata THEN the system SHALL include relevant cryptocurrency and blockchain tags in Chinese

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site maintainer, I want the generated articles to be automatically committed to the GitHub repository, so that the content is published without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN articles are generated THEN the system SHALL save them as markdown files in the /content/posts directory
2. WHEN saving files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames with date and topic information
3. WHEN committing to GitHub THEN the system SHALL create a commit with a descriptive message indicating the automated content generation
4. WHEN pushing to GitHub THEN the system SHALL ensure the files are properly formatted and follow Hugo conventions
5. WHEN processing multiple articles THEN the system SHALL handle all three articles in a single execution cycle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want the content generation to run automatically twice daily, so that my site always has fresh, trending cryptocurrency content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up automation THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Actions for scheduling and execution
2. WHEN scheduling runs THEN the system SHALL execute at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM daily (Beijing time)
3. WHEN running automatically THEN the system SHALL complete the entire workflow from Twitter search to GitHub commit
4. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and continue processing remaining tweets if possible
5. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully and retry when appropriate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the generated articles to be automatically built into HTML pages, so that I can view the latest cryptocurrency content on the live website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN markdown articles are pushed to GitHub THEN the system SHALL automatically run Hugo build commands (hugo --minify)
2. WHEN running Hugo build THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding HTML pages for the new articles in the public/ directory
3. WHEN building the site THEN the system SHALL ensure the generated HTML pages are properly formatted and accessible
4. WHEN completing the build process THEN the system SHALL deploy the updated site to the hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages)
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL handle the complete workflow from markdown creation to live site update
6. WHEN build fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages and notify maintainers via configured channels
7. WHEN Hugo build succeeds THEN the system SHALL verify that new article pages are accessible via HTTP response check

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want to ensure no duplicate content is published, so that the site maintains high quality and avoids redundant articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing new tweets THEN the system SHALL check for existing articles with similar content using SHA-256 hash comparison
2. WHEN detecting potential duplicates THEN the system SHALL compare tweet content, URLs, tweet IDs, and semantic similarity (>85% threshold)
3. WHEN finding duplicate content THEN the system SHALL skip generating articles for already processed tweets and log the skip action
4. WHEN maintaining uniqueness THEN the system SHALL store processed tweet IDs and content hashes in a persistent database/file for at least 30 days
5. WHEN handling similar topics THEN the system SHALL ensure articles provide unique perspectives or information through content fingerprinting
6. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL differentiate between original tweets and retweets, prioritizing original content
7. WHEN duplicate detection fails THEN the system SHALL err on the side of caution and skip content generation rather than risk duplication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be maintainable and configurable, so that I can adjust keywords, scheduling, and content formatting as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL store API keys and sensitive information securely using GitHub Secrets
2. WHEN modifying search terms THEN the system SHALL allow easy configuration of cryptocurrency keywords
3. WHEN updating templates THEN the system SHALL use the existing md-template.md as the base template for article generation
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL provide clear logs of API calls, content generation, and file operations
5. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. WHEN using md-template.md THEN the system SHALL dynamically populate all template fields including Chinese translations for tags and categories
7. WHEN populating metadata THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the template's author information and site branding

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and API management, so that the system can handle failures gracefully and recover automatically when possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Twitter API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
2. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests for the next available time window
3. WHEN fewer than 3 qualifying tweets are found THEN the system SHALL generate articles for available tweets and log the shortfall
4. WHEN translation services fail THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative translation methods or fallback to original content with warnings
5. WHEN Hugo build fails THEN the system SHALL preserve previous site version and send detailed error notifications
6. WHEN GitHub push fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with increasing delay intervals
7. WHEN any critical failure occurs THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications via configured alert channels (email, Slack, etc.)
8. WHEN system recovers from failure THEN the system SHALL log recovery status and resume normal operations
